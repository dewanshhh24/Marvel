## 📌 Project Status & API Note

⚠️ **Important Note about Marvel API**

During development, the **Marvel Developer API / Gateway was unavailable**, which caused API requests to fail.

Because of this:
- The current repository contains **frontend-only code**
- API integration logic is present but may not function until the Marvel API is stable again
- No private API keys are exposed in this repository

The project is structured in a way that allows **easy re-integration of the API or a backend proxy** in the future.
